# Contribute to the development of HelloDATA BE
We look forward to your contributions to this project and ask you to to consider.


## GitHub Permissions (Commits and Pull Requests)

In principle, all GitHub users have the right to open pull requests (PRs) and issues. The committer rights (write access to the code) are held by the suppliers selected by the Canton of Bern.

The supplier is responsible for carrying out the technical code review process for external contributions that have been technically accepted by the Canton of Bern. The supplier is responsible for the technical quality.

Additional details on contributing to HelloDATA BE can be found on GitHub.

## Review Process

Code reviews are conducted by at least one person acting as a committer. The supplier is responsible for carrying out the technical code review process for external contributions that have been accepted by the HelloDATA BE steering committee. They bear responsibility for the technical quality.

## Handling Reported Errors

Reported errors are attempted to be reproduced and corrected. Active participation of the reporting individual is required. If reproduction is successful, the Canton of Bern commissions the supplier to fix the errors. If the error cannot be replicated or if the effort to correct it is disproportionately high, an apology is issued to the reporter, and they are asked if they could submit a Pull Request to resolve the error.

## Handling Inquiries

Every inquiry is responded to as quickly as possible. If an inquiry cannot be resolved with reasonable effort and further time expenditure appears inefficient, an apology is issued with a note on limited resources, and it is offered to contact a supplier for further consultation.

## Handling Pull Requests
GitHub pull requests are used exclusively. Read the [GitHub Help](https://help.github.com/articles/about-pull-requests/) to learn more about pull requests.

The goal is to receive as many high-quality Pull Requests as possible. All active contributors are involved in the reviews and technical as well as professional assessment of the Pull Requests wherever sensible. Every Pull Request is reviewed favorably. To avoid unnecessary effort by the contributor, they are informed at the outset if something contradicts our roadmap or it is questionable whether the contribution will be accepted. The Canton of Bern decides which contributions are accepted based on the processes and professional criteria described in Chapter X. Error corrections that have passed the review process are always accepted.

## Handling Forks

Forks should ideally be unnecessary, as active and open community management is practiced. If forks do arise, they are actively reviewed, and attempts are made to integrate any resulting extensions and improvements. In this case, Pull Requests are actively requested.
