# HelloDATA BE: Open-Source Enterprise Data Platform

> The Open Enterprise Data Platform in a Single Portal

HelloDATA BE integrates the prowess of open-source tools into a unified, enterprise-grade data platform. It simplifies end-to-end data engineering by converging tools like dbt, Airflow, and Superset, anchored on a robust Postgres database. Our platform encapsulates the agility of open source with the dependability of enterprise solutions, streamlining your data workflow in one accessible portal.

## Vision and Goal

Agile and transparent data platforms are vital in a rapidly evolving digital landscape. HelloDATA BE tries to help by offering an open-source solution tailored to enterprise needs. Our mission is to democratize data and provide end-to-end- innovation-driven data handling. [Learn More](docs/docs/vision/vision-and-goal.md).


## Quick Start

**Essential Setup**
1. **Docker Desktop Settings**: For Mac users, adjust Docker Desktop settings for multi-platform support (especially for arm64-chip users). [Details](hello-data-deployment/docker-compose/README.md#mac).
2. **Hosts File Entry**: Ensure `127.0.0.1 host.docker.internal` is added to `/etc/hosts`. For Windows enable in Docker Desktop WSL settings [How to](hello-data-deployment/docker-compose/README.md#prepare-environment).

**Start-Up Instructions**

Change directory to `hello-data-deployment/docker-compose` and run:
```sh
docker-compose up -d
```

Pulling all images and starting up the containers will take a while. Once completed, access the web portal at [localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080) (default: admin/admin).

> **Note:**
> - Detailed start-up instructions, troubleshooting, and FAQs are in the [docker-compose README](hello-data-deployment/docker-compose/README.md).
> - Specific setup information for [Windows users](hello-data-deployment/docker-compose/README.md#windows).

## Key Features

HelloDATA BE is more than a platform; it's a holistic data solution:

- Unified enterprise data platform with a seamless open-source toolkit.
- Domain-centric architecture for effective data governance.
- Robust data modeling with lineage tracking.
- Real-time insights into runs and orchestrations.
- Company-wide dashboard creation and sharing.

## Architecture and Components

HelloDATA BE is built with modularity and extensibility architecture in mind, supported by [NATS](https://nats.io/), [Keycloak](https://www.keycloak.org/), and more, ensuring secure, efficient, and adaptable data handling. [Explore the Architecture](docs/docs/architecture/architecture.md).

### [Domain View](docs/docs/architecture/architecture.md): Business and Data Domains
The different views are a vital aspect of the HelloDATA BE. Adding multiple business domains with n data domains makes it enterprise-ready out of the box.

- **Business Domain**: Core services, including portal, orchestration, and monitoring.
- **Data Domain**: The heart of data storage, encompassing tables/schemas, dbt data models, data marts, DWH environments, and more.

Multiple Data Domains coexist in each business domain, each with dedicated storage and specialized data models. [Dive Deeper](docs/docs/architecture/architecture.md). Also, check the [User Manual](docs/docs/manuals/user-manual.md) for a detailed functional overview.
